# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require
you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the
right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether
you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check,
comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need
to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

# Technical Guidance
This module doesn't require a build, all the code is in Powershell. While contributing please use the same codding style as used throughout the project. It may not be your default codding style, but for the project consistency it would be better to use the same style everywhere.

I personally work with VS Code with Powershell code nowadays. Any editor would do, but VS Code with Powershell extension installed would ensure you can reformat the code with the same code style convention used. Hit Shift+Alt+F to format the currently opened document.

All exported commands need to provide documentation with an example.
